## Usage

Before running `run.py`, youâ€™ll need to modify some variables in `login_info.py` to fit your personal information.

Modify the following fields in `login_info.py`:

1.	Personal Information:
    ```python
    first_name = 'adam'     # your first name
    last_name = 'smith'     # your last name
    date_of_birth = '01/01/2001'  # your DOB in the format MM/DD/YYYY 
    last4ssn = '0000'       # your last four digits of SSN, enter 0000 if you don't have a SSN
    ```
2.	WeChat Notification:
    ```python
    WX_RECEIVER = 'chat_channel'  # The name of your contact in WeChat where notifications will be sent.
    ```
3.	Target Appointment Date:
    ```python
    TARGATE_DATE = datetime(2024, 9, 5)  # Set your target date, so the script will only notify if there are spots available before 9/5/2024
    ```
4. County Selection:
    ```python
    county = franklin  # Choose your county from the available options: franklin, fairfield, union, delaware.
    ```
    Available counties:
    ```python
    franklin = 'Franklin'
    fairfield = 'Fairfield'
    union = 'Union'
    delaware = 'Delaware'
    ```
    You can add more counties as you want.

Once you have modified the necessary fields in `login_info.py`, you can execute `run.py` to check available slots for the specific county.
